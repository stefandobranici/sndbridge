      "Hey, im rach kay and i’ve been djing for 4 years. I started learning to dj when I was at Uni in Bristol, after working in a few different night clubs! I then kept practicing at home and got my first residency, playing every friday night for 6 hours! Since then i’ve been lucky enough to play all over the UK, as well as internationally in places such as Vancouver, Ibiza, Marbella and Greece! I’ve also warmed up for Ne-yo, HER and The Internet on their UK tours, and have been featured on  BBC 1xtra, KISS FM and Capital Xtra. I am also a resident DJ on BBC Wiltshire, and all of my mixtapes & radio shows can be found at www.mixcloud.com/rachkaydj",

      "After being a Reggae host and MC for many of my younger years my head turned to being a collector of Soulful House Music in 2013. I have a natural love for vocals (especially Female) and used to freely share my Tracks with Family and Friends. I then treated myself to a Controller and taught myself to Beatmatch, in 2017 made the decision to start playing locally just to gain the confidence. Previous Audio mixes can be found on Mixcloud (TH3 MARQUES) ..Numerous mixes including Soulful, Funky, Deep and Afro House for your listening pleasure. If Music is food ....Lets Eat..!!",
